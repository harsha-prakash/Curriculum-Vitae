# Curriculum-Vitae
A LaTeX type-scripted curriculum vitae for academic and professional information

### Overview
This repository contains my CV created with Overleaf using LaTeX. Overleaf is a highly versatile cloud-based Latex editor, rich with templates for any scientific docs. I personally preferred Latex as it spruces your Resume/Cv with neat and orderly indentations. 

### Motivation 
I created this CV for future research collaboration requests and to act as a general documentation of my experiences and skills. I found this 2-page resume slick and presentable than a congested 1-page/double column formats. Feel free to use my code and fork it for your own twitching, but do mention the licensing of Latex under MIT.
